# Newly Created SPIs
## These are new Simpl+ modules that are not in EMS's existing code.
### The "Set Selected Cams IP" Simpl+ Code would have to be manually extended (just repeating existing code based on # of cameras used.)
*NOTE: If preferred, John's Analog Serial Selector seems to handle this functionality
### The "BluRay" Simpl+ will be used.  
*NOTE: From testing the BluRay, unsure if a Queue or Buffer will be needed, so commands don't collide.
